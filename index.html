      <h2><u>What is ChatGPT?</u></h2>
      <div class="text1">
        <p>ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence chatbot created by OpenAI that uses natural
          language processing to create humanlike conversational dialogue. The language
          model can respond to questions and compose various written content, including
          articles, social media posts, and essays.</p>
        <p>ChatGPT uses deep learning, a subset of machine learning, to produce
          humanlike text through transformer neural networks. The transformer predicts
          text including the next word, sentence, or paragraph based on its training data&#39;s
          typical sequence.</p>

                <p>The advent of ChatGPT has accelerated a variety of growing concerns within the
                  worldâ€™s education systems, the most important of which, arguably, is academic
                  integrity. Because ChatGPT provides a free, simple to use resource that can
                  generate human-like responses requiring minimal human input, the reflective
                  ways students&#39; study and show a grasp on the subjects they are studying through
                  written essays is in peril.</p>
                <p>With over 100 million users within its first two months of release, ChatGPT
                  became one of the fastest growing apps in history, which surprised its creators
                  OpenAI who saw it as nothing more than a research project and never
                  anticipated the profound impact it would have on society.</p>
                <p>Universities and places of study have been in near constant debate about the
                  future of education as we know it because of A.I tech like ChatGPT.</p>

          <h2><u>My Product - <b>"CheatsGPT"</b></u></h2>
            <p>I decided I wanted to focus on a project that sees Technology attempting to fix a
               problem caused by Technology. As my partner works for our
               local university, ChatGPT has been a hot topic of discussion in our household
               and I felt it would make for an interesting thought experiment.</p> 
            <p>Counteracting Human Educational Abuse of Technological Systems, or
               CheatsGPT abbreviated, is an adaptive A.I comparable in scope to ChatGPT,
               designed to check assignment submissions across the globe for similarities with
              articles / essays produced by ChatGPT.</p> 
      <p>CheatsGPT is achieved as follows:</p> 
      <ul>
        <li><u><strong>Stage 1:</strong></u> Form a database of essays created by responses from ChatGPT
          using thousands of common keywords as prompts and human written
          essays as a baseline</li>
        <li><u><strong>Stage 2:</strong></u> Compare the uploaded student essay with the database</li>
        <li><u><strong>Stage 3:</strong></u> Calculate the Probability of Plagiarism (PoP) index - a percentage
          chance that the essay was produced by ChatGPT based on sentence
          structure, word usage, grammar, and content relevance</li>
      </ul>
          <p>CheatsGPT subsequently uses uploaded essays to self-improve and learn the
            difference between A.I and human written essays, furthering its abilities to detect
            A.I Plagiarism.</p>
          <p>Initial market research shows a similar product currently exists called ZeroGPT,
            however with one major difference; ZeroGPT is limited by its original
            programming with no ability to learn or adapt.</p>
      </ul>
        </div>
    <h2><u>Who would benefit?</u></h2>
    <div class="text1">
     <p>Education professionals across schools, colleges, and universities would benefit
      greatly from being able to decipher whether material has been created by
      students or not. However, I truly believe that essay writing and the reflective
      nature of demonstrating knowledge gained from studying is fundamental to
      learning, so ultimately those who would benefit most would be students
      themselves. An over-reliance on programs like ChatGPT will inevitably decrease
      knowledge retention and potentially create generations of graduates with
      unlearned skills.</p>
     <p>Simply knowing a tool like CheatsGPT exists and is being widely used by
      universities could deter students from considering the use of A.I to skip core
      subject matter.</p>
    </div>
    <h2><u>Why would it fail?</u></h2>
     <div class="text1">
     <p>ChatGPT took 5 years to develop using the shell of the original program GPT3.
      This was a significant investment in time and resources and it had some brilliant
      minds working on it. One could therefore argue whether another program of its
      scale could even be created without the original members of OpenAI who worked
      on it.</p>
     <p>Technology is forever advancing and as demonstrated with Viruses and
      Antiviruses there is a near constant arms race to make the next product to beat
      the last. Without constant development and updates, CheatsGPT will eventually
      become obsolete as the next super A.I is released.</p>
     <p>And ultimately, Cheats GPT is not able to provide definitive proof of plagiarism.
      Even with an incredibly high probability of a paper being matched on the A.I
      database, there would still be a chance (however slim) that a student could have
      written the essay themselves.</p>
