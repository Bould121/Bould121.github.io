      <h2><u>What is ChatGPT?</u></h2>
      <div class="text1">
        <p> ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence chatbot created by OpenAI that uses natural language processing to create humanlike conversational dialogue. The language model can respond to questions and compose various written content, including articles, social media posts and essays.<br>
          ChatGPT uses deep learning, a subset of machine learning, to produce humanlike text through transformer neural networks. The transformer predicts text including the next word, sentence or paragraph based on its training data's typical sequence.

              <p>With the advent of ChatGPT, the education system and the reflective ways students study and show a grasp on the subjects they are studying through written essays is in peril, ChatGPT provides a free, simple to use resource that can generate human-like responses requiring minimal human input.<br>
                 With over 100 million users ChatGPT became one of the fastest growing app's in history which suprised its creators OpenAI who saw it as nothing more than a research project and didn't expect it to have the profound impact it has had on society.<br>
                Universities and places of study have been in near constant debate about the future of education as we know it because of A.I tech like ChatGPT. </p>

    <h2><u>My Product - <b>"CheatsGPT"</b></u></h2>
      <p>I decided early I wanted to focus on a project that involved Tech attempting to fix a problem caused by Tech, My partner works at our local university and this has been a hot topic of discussion in our household and thought it would make for an interesting thought experiment.<br><b>Counteracting Human Educational Abuse (of) Technology Systems</b> or CheatsGPT for short would be an adaptive A.I comparable in scope to ChatGPT designed to 
        check students work uploaded by professors across the globe for similarities with articles / essays produced by ChatGPT <br>
        It would achieve this by forming a database of essays created by responses from ChatGPT using thousands of common keywords as prompts and human written essays as a baseline and then compare the uploaded student essays with the database to give a Probabilty of Plagiarism (PoP) index - a percentage chance of it being a ChatGPT produced work based on sentence structure, word usage, grammar and content relevance, It would then use these uploaded documents to better help itself learn the difference between A.I and human written essays further improving its abilities.  <br>
      I've searched online to try and find something similar to this product and the closest examples I could find was<a href="https://gptzero.me/"> ZeroGPT </a> (which is annoyingly similar, theres no such thing as an original idea !) the major difference being ZeroGPT is limited by its original programming with no ability to learn / adapt.  </p>
