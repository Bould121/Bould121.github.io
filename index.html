      <h2><u>What is ChatGPT?</u></h2>
      <div class="text1">
        <p> ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence chatbot created by OpenAI that uses natural language processing to create humanlike conversational dialogue. The language model can respond to questions and compose various written content, including articles, social media posts and essays.<br>
          ChatGPT uses deep learning, a subset of machine learning, to produce humanlike text through transformer neural networks. The transformer predicts text including the next word, sentence or paragraph based on its training data's typical sequence.

                <p>With the advent of ChatGPT, the education system and the reflective ways students' study and show a grasp on the subjects they are studying through written essays is in peril, ChatGPT provides a free, simple to use resource that can generate human-like responses requiring minimal human input.<br> 
                  <br>With over 100 million users within its first two months of release ChatGPT became one of the fastest growing apps in history which surprised its creators OpenAI who saw it as nothing more than a research project and didn't expect it to have the profound impact it has had on society.<br> 
                  Universities and places of study have been in near constant debate about the future of education as we know it because of A.I tech like ChatGPT. </p>

    <h2><u>My Product - <b>"CheatsGPT"</b></u></h2>
      <p>I decided I wanted to focus on a project that involved Tech attempting to fix a problem caused by Tech, My partner works at our local university and this has been a hot topic of discussion in our household and thought it would make for an interesting thought experiment.<br><br><b>Counteracting Human Educational Abuse (of) Technological Systems</b> or CheatsGPT for short would be an adaptive A.I comparable in scope to ChatGPT designed to 
        check students work uploaded by professors across the globe for similarities with articles / essays produced by ChatGPT. <br> 
        It would achieve this by forming a database of essays created by responses from ChatGPT using thousands of common keywords as prompts and human written essays as a baseline and then compare the uploaded student essays with the database to give a Probability of Plagiarism (PoP) index - a percentage chance of it being a ChatGPT produced work based on sentence structure, word usage, grammar and content relevance.<br> It would then use these uploaded documents to better help itself learn the difference between A.I and human written essays further improving its abilities to detect A.I Plagiarism.  <br>
        I've searched online to try and find something similar to this product and the closest example I could find was<a href="https://gptzero.me/"> ZeroGPT </a> (which is annoyingly similar) the major difference being ZeroGPT is limited by its original programming with no ability to learn / adapt.  </p> 
        </div>
    <h2><u>Who would benefit?</u></h2>
    <div class="text1">
      <p>Teachers and universities would benefit hugely from being able to decipher whether material has been created by students or not but 
        ultimately the people who would benefit most from this would be students themselves,
         I truly believe that essays and the reflective nature of demonstrating knowledge gained when studying is hugely important and using programs such as ChatGPT to avoid this part of learning will lower students rentention overall.
         <br><br>Simply knowing a tool like this existed and was potentially widely used by universities could act as a deterant to students debating on using A.I to skip core subject matter.  </p>
    </div>
    <h2><u>Why would it fail?</u></h2>
     <div class="text1">
      <p>ChatGPT took 5 years to develop using the shell of the original program GPT3, this was obviously a huge investment in time and resources and had some brilliant minds working on it, its debatable whether another program could even be created without the original members of OpenAI who worked on it.
        <br><br>Technology is forever advancing and as demonstrated with Virus's and Anti-virus's there is a near constant arms race to make the next product to beat the last, without constant development and updates it would eventually become obsolete as the next super A.I is released.<br><br>
      And ultimately even with an incredibly high % chance of a paper being matched on the A.I database there would still be a chance (however slim) that a student could have written the essay themselves, it wouldn't be definitive proof.  </p>
